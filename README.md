# Mondrian-Project-
The Mondrian Project is a method of organizing and managing web applications or projects in a modular, scalable way, often inspired by Piet Mondrian's abstract, grid-based art. The core idea is to divide a project into distinct, manageable sections or "modules" (just as Mondrian used distinct color blocks).
